				<p>For this project we were assigned an invention. The project was based off the industrial revolution. Our group was assigned baking powder. 
				What we had to do was first research on our invention, then create a sketch of it, and then a physical model.</p>
				<center>
					<p>This was our sketch. We basically sketched out how our baking powder can would look like. We would use this as an "idea" on what we would present</p>

					<p>This is our model. What we did was recreate a baking powder can, as well as make our own making powder for it. We would use this to present our "product".</p>

					<p>Along with this, we also had to reserach on our invention. We looked throught various websites to find information about our invention.</p>

				<p>After creating our inventions, we had to create a "press release" of our invention (us basically adverstising our image as a company would). 
				The press release was a slideshow with information on baking power, such as it's chemistry, history, and use. Click on it to see it.</p>
